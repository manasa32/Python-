#  Requirements:
#     * The system should allow to update or add the products to the inventory
#     * Each Product should have 
#         * Id
#         * Name
#         * Model
#         * Cost Price
#         * Selling Price
#         * Number of Items
#     * The System should allow to sell items which means the inventory should be updated.
#     * The system should show the report of items sold
